FAQ

Why can't I send payment immediately? There are lots of ways to cheat with Amazon. The buyer can cancel the order before it's delivered. Amazon can recall the package if they detect fraud (if it was purchased with a stolen credit card, gift card, or stolen account/password). It's best to wait until the product is in your hands.
